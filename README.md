# Linked List Project

## What Is This Project

This C project reads the .txt file that contains a list of cities in Turkiye and their neighboring cities and creates a linked list with them. The user can add new cities and new neighbors to existing cities and the program will rellocate its memory acordingly. The user can also perform [some queries](#what-queries-can-it-perform).

## What Queries Can It Perform

- The user can query for licence plate code and city name. If the city isn't found, the program will ask the user if they would like to create that city with the given parameters.
